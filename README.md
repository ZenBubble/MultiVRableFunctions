# MultiVRableFunctions
This is a program I made in Unity 2022.3.17f1 in order to make an educational tool for learning multivariable functions. It is intended to visualize multivariable functions in vr to gain a deeper understanding of how these functions "look like." I'm still learning multivariable calculus myself, so feel free to suggest any changes.

## Implemented Features
- None yet :)

## Todo
- Script currently makes points, connect them to actually get a plane/surface
- Have interactable elemetns like scale in vr
- Have custom input for functions, either in vr or on desktop
- Be able to go on top of the functions and visualize the directiuonal derivative and how its the steepest direction, as well as traverse the graph using climbing gloves
